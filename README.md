- ðŸ‘‹ Hi,I'm Harsha Hampapura. I am an Associate Scientist II in the Computation and Information System Lab, NCAR. I currently work on exploring how climate scientists can best 
  leverage the capabilities of the Open Science Data Federation (OSDF) and the Open Science Pool (OS Pool). To this end, I identify and develop reference computational workflows.
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m broadly interested in climate dynamics and the use of machine learning to deal with various aspects of climate change. 
- ðŸŒ± I have a PhD in theoretical physics and climate dynamics from Brandeis University.
- ðŸ“« Reach me @hrhampapura
